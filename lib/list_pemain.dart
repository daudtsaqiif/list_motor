    biography:
        'Hailing from Nkol Ngok in Cameroon, Andre Onana has proven himself in Europe as a talented keeper who isnt shy to have the ball at his feet.Onana spent his formative years at the Samuel Etoo Academy before moving to Barcelonas famed La Masia youth system.Having learned to feel comfortable in possession, and after spending time in Spain on loan, Onana made a permanent move to Eredivisie side Ajax in 2015.He started out in Jong Ajax, the youth system of the Amsterdam club, but just one year after he signed, Andre made his senior debut. On 20 August 2016, aged 20, the Cameroonian started Ajaxs league fixture against Willem II.Onanas club form also led to him receiving his first call-up to the national team, making his international debut shortly after, on 6 September 2016 against Gabon.In his debut season, Andre helped Ajax to a second-placed finish in the league and the Dutch side reached the final of the Europa League, where they were defeated by Manchester United.Following Erik ten Hags first full season in charge at the Amsterdam ArenA, Onana won his first silverware. Ajax won the Eredivisie and KNVB Cup double in 2019, with the Cameroonian playing a key role, with 55 appearances and 26 clean sheets.The goalkeeper experienced further success with the Dutch giants, but the Covid pandemic and a lengthy ban impacted the end of Onanas time at Ajax.He moved to Internazionale in the summer of 2022 and, in what would prove to be his only season at the club, Onana played 41 times and kept 19 clean sheets. In Milan, he won the Coppa Italia and the Supercopa Italiana, and manned the goal during Champions League final that they narrowly lost to Manchester City.On 20 July 2023, his transfer to Manchester United was confirmed, re-connecting him, Ten Hag, Lisandro Martinez and Antony from their time at Ajax together, plus Donny van de Beek too. Onana featured in all but one game during his first campaign in Manchester, and ended it an FA Cup winner, following an excellent performance against Manchester City in the final at Wembley.',

    biography:
        'Bruno Fernandes took an unusual path to the top when compared to other Portuguese talents who have served Manchester United.While the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani made their names in Portugal, Fernandes spent the first five years of his career in Italy.A youth product at Boavista, the midfielder signed for Serie B club in Novara in August 2012, at the age of 17. Initially suffering from homesickness, he eventually grew into his new environment, teaching himself Italian and helping the Blues to fifth position, before joining Udinese in Italys top tier.Three seasons in Udine yielded 11 goals in 95 appearances, convincing Sampdoria to clinch his signature in the summer of 2016. International recognition as part of Portugal’s Olympic squad followed, before Bruno captained the Under-21s at the UEFA European Championships in 2017.After shining in a solitary season with Sampdoria, Bruno moved back home, signing for Sporting Clube de Portugal. Although he had mostly played in Italy as a deep midfielder, Fernandes now took on the role of playmaker at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, contributing 16 goals and 20 assists in his first Primeira Liga campaign.That record, coupled with a Portuguese League Cup win, helped Fernandes gain his first senior international cap, and he was later selected for Fernando Santos’ 2018 World Cup squad in Russia.Named Primeira Liga Player of the Year in July 2018, Bruno picked up where he left off the following season, hitting an incredible 20 league goals from midfield and assisting a further 13. The Lions claimed the Portuguese Cup and League Cup double and the midfielder, who was named club captain after Nani’s departure, once again picked up Portugal’s premier individual accolade.He was part of the national team squad which won the inaugural UEFA Nations League in June 2019, only Portugal’s second major trophy.After a productive first half of 2019/20, during which he helped Sporting to the last 32 of the UEFA Europa League, he completed his move to Old Trafford on 30 January 2020. He made his Reds debut two days later, during the 0-0 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.It wasnt long before the Portugueses impact was felt. He delivered his first assist in just his second game – a 2-0 win at Chelsea – and then scored his first goal (from the penalty spot) on his third start. And that was just a taste of what was to come: Bruno scored 12 goals and provided eight assists before the end of the season, and was arguably the driving force behind Uniteds impressive run to a third-place finish in the Premier League.He was named the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year for the season, despite playing just half of the campaign.Bruno began 2020/21 in fine style, too, scoring a dramatic 100th-minute winner from the spot at Brighton. Fernandes was Uniteds - and maybe even the Premier Leagues - standout performer during the first half of the campaign, claiming the clubs and leagues Player of the Month awards for November and December.In helping the Reds to a second-placed finish, and the Europa League final, Bruno scored 28 goals, overtaking Frank Lampards record for a midfielder in a single season in the Premier League era. He picked up his second Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year trophy, in front of returning fans at Old Trafford, and also won the clubs Goal of the Season prize for a spectacular effort against Everton.In April 2022, Bruno signed a new long-term contract with club, rewarding his work since his arrival from Sporting. The deal is due to run until 2026, with the option of a further year. He lifted his first trophy at United in February 2023, as the Reds beat Newcastle United 2-0 in the Carabao Cup final. He also scored in the Emirates FA Cup final defeat to Manchester City at Wembley, as he finished on 14 goals and 15 assists in his 59 club games across a mammoth campaign.',
